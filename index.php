            <h2>In 2+ sentences describe who you are and what you do.</h2>
            <p>My name is Nicholas Egan. I'm a rising high school senior who lives in the San Francisco area and is attending 
                the Harvard Summer School Program.</p>
            
            <h2>Why are you taking this course?</h2>
            <p>I'm taking this course because I love programming and would like to learn more about making web applications 
                with more advanced tools.</p>
            
            <h2>What previous experience do you have with HTML/CSS?</h2>
            <p>I've been making websites for several years now, and have been building websites for clients. You can see
                my portfolio at <a href="http://www.egansoft.com/">egansoft.com</a>.</p>
            
            <h2>What previous experience do you have with programming?</h2>
            <p>I started programming when I was in fifth grade and it has been my passion ever since. I've been mostly
                working with Java recently, and you can see a portfolio of android apps I have made at 
                <a href="http://www.egansoft.com/">egansoft.com</a>.</p>
            
            <h2>Have you worked with PHP before? If so, to what extent?</h2>
            <p>I have worked with PHP a bit in the past, through initially reading a beginer's book and later through
                googling. I don't however have a very strong foundation in PHP and would like to become better at it
                through this class.</p>
